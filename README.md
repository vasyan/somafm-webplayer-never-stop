### Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script to fix SomaFM stalls

The [SomaFM](https://somafm.com) web player occasionally stalls, requiring a page reload. This issue occurs across all browsers I've tested and with several js-players found on GitHub. This script provides a dirty, yet effective, solution by automatically monitoring for issues with audio playback and reloading the page to restore the music.
This issue may be related to my ISP or hardware, as my searches have yielded no results on this problem. Regardless, if you're experiencing something similar, I hope this script will help.
